### <font color="#2DC26B">1. Var</font>

- The var statement declares function-scoped or globally-scoped variables.
   
```js
var x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
    var x = 2;
    console.log(x); // Expected output: 2 
} 
console.log(x); // Expected output: 2

```

-  A variable declared with `var` is scoped to the nearest enclosing function body or static initialization block, or if neither applies, to the current module in module mode or the global scope in script mode.
- Block constructs, including block statements, try...catch , switch , headers of one of the for statements, do not create scopes for var , and variables declared with var inside such a block can continue to be referenced outside the block, making it Global scoped.
