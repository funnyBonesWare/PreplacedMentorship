> Currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each takes a single argument.

Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable multiple times, and it helps you create a higher order function.

## <font color="#4bacc6">Why Is Currying in JavaScript Useful?</font>

1. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable again and again.
2. It helps to create a higher order function.

Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence/series of functions, each taking a single argument.

For example:

``` js
function sum(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
sum(1,2,3); // 6
```

As you can see, this is a function with full arguments. Let’s create a curried version of the function and see how we would call the same function (and get the same result) in a series of calls

```js
function sum(a) {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a + b + c
        }
    }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)) // 6
```

We could even separate this `sum(1)(2)(3)` to understand it better:

```js
const sum1 = sum(1);
const sum2 = sum1(2);
const result = sum2(3);
console.log(result); // 6
```

## <font color="#4bacc6">How Does Currying in JavaScript Work?</font>

Let’s look at how currying works. We passed `1` to the `sum` function:

```js
let sum1 = sum(1);
```

It returns the function:

``` js
return (b) => {
    return (c) => {
        return a + b + c
    }
}
```

Now, `sum1` holds the above function definition, which takes an argument `b`.

We called the `sum1` function, passing in `2`:

```js
let sum2 = sum1(2);
```

The `sum1` will return the third function:

```js
return (c) => {
        return a + b + c
}
```

The returned function is now stored in the `sum2` variable.
`sum2` will be:

```js
sum2 = (c) => { 
	return a + b + c 
}
```

When `sum2` is called with `3` as the parameter `const result = sum2(3);`, it does the calculation with the previously passed in parameters: `a = 1`, `b = 2` and returns `6`.

```js
console.log(result); // 6
```

The last function only accepts the `c` variable, but it will perform the operation with other variables whose enclosing function scope has long since returned. It works nonetheless because of  **<font color="#c00000">Closure</font>**.

Closures make currying work by letting each nested function “remember” the arguments passed so far, even after its outer function has finished.
- **First Call (`sum(1)`)**
    
    - When you call `sum(1)`, JavaScript creates a new function that takes `b`. That inner function closes over (i.e., captures) the variable `a = 1`. Even after `sum` returns, this returned function still “knows” that `a` is 1.
        
- **Second Call (`sum(1)(2)`)**
    
    - You now call the returned function with `2`. This gives you yet another function that takes `c`. It closes over both `a = 1` and `b = 2`. Thanks to the closure, that innermost function retains access to both values from its outer scopes.
        
- **Final Call (`sum(1)(2)(3)`)**
    
    - Calling the innermost function with `3` triggers `a + b + c`. The closure makes sure `a` and `b` are still available, so it correctly computes `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

Without closures, each nested layer wouldn’t remember earlier arguments. Currying transforms a three-argument function into a chain of single-argument functions; closures ensure each step retains the previous values until the very last call. This pattern, rooted in classic functional programming, not only keeps your code modular and elegant but also opens the door to more advanced techniques—like partial application or building configurable helpers—pushing JavaScript forward in a traditional, time-tested way.
## <font color="#4bacc6">Basic vs. Advanced Currying Techniques</font>

Basically, there are two types of Currying in JavaScript. Let us have a look at them.
1. **Basic Currying**
2. **Advanced Currying**
In Basic currying, a single argument is taken by the function and returns a series of functions under which all the other parameters are contained.

In this currying, the function is incomplete until all the parameters are received by the function. Otherwise, the function will not give any **fruitful results**.

While in Advanced currying, there is a fixed number of parameters in the function. In it, the function is received as an outer function which is a **wrapper function**.

Let us see examples of both the currying in JavaScript for better understanding.

- **Basic currying**:
```js
const getCakeIngredients = (ingred_1) =>{ // function is declared here
    return (ingred_2) => {
        return (ingred_3) => {
            return ${ingred_1}, ${ingred_2}, ${ingred_3}; 
        } 
    } 
} 
getCakeIngredients('Eggs')('flour')('milk');
```

**Explanation**: In the above code, a function "getCakeIngredients" is created whose argument is "ingred_1". This "ingred_1" will return a series of functions as other ingredients that we required for making the cake. This function will be incomplete until it receives all the ingredients as a parameter.

- **Advanced currying**:
```js
const adv_curry =(fn) =>{ // here the function is a outer function
    return curried = (...args) => { 
        if (fn.length !== args.length){ // comparison of function length is done here 
            return curried.bind(null, ...args)
        }
    return fn(...args);
    };
}
const totalNum=(a,b,c) => {
    return a+b+c 
} 
const curriedTotal = adv_curry(totalNum);
console.log(curriedTotal(5) (15) (20));
```

**Explanation**: In the above example, the **"Adv_curry"** function is received as the outer function which is a 'wrapper function'. Here one more function is 'curried' returned which receives arguments with an operator named '**spread operator**'.

This operator is for comparison of the function length 'fn.length'. Spread operator in JavaScript is used to fast copying of array or object into another array or object. This copying can copy all the parts or some part of the array or object as specified by the user.

The number of arguments passed here will show the length property of the function. The arguments will keep increasing every time the calling of function.
## <font color="#4bacc6">Modern Currying With ES6</font>

ES6 is the new modifications and improvisations in the syntax of JavaScript. The arrow function is used for currying in JavaScript. Modern currying can be done using this modern syntax as given in the below example.

```js
const sendReq = greet => name => message =>
`${greet} ${name}, ${message}`
sendReq('Hello')('Harry')('Can you please add me as your connection on LinkedinIn?')
```

**Output**:

```js
Can you please add me as your connection on LinkedinIn?
```

## <font color="#4bacc6">Currying Can be Used to Manipulate the DOM in Javascript</font>

Currying in JavaScript is also used to modify the Document Object Model in JavaScript. As we know, in currying a function is rewritten with **multiple arguments** into a series of functions. This affects the appearance of the whole structure of a web page.

Currying simply means breaking a multi-argument function into a chain of single-argument functions. When you “curry” a DOM helper, each step remembers its input so you don’t repeat yourself. Here’s a super beginner-friendly look:

1.**Pick an Element Once**

```js
const select = (selector) => () => document.querySelector(selector);
const getButton = select('#myButton');
// Now getButton() always fetches that same element.
```

2.Attach Events in Steps

```js
const on = (eventType) => (selector) => (handler) => {
  const el = document.querySelector(selector);
  if (el) el.addEventListener(eventType, handler);
};
const onClickButton = on('click')('#myButton');
onClickButton(() => alert('Clicked!'));
```

First you “lock in” the event type (`'click'`), then the selector (`'#myButton'`), and finally the handler. Each nested function keeps the earlier choice in a closure.

3.**Why It Helps**
    - No Repetition:You don’t rewrite the same selector or event everywhere.
    - Readability: `onClickButton(...)` clearly means “add a click listener to `#myButton`.”
    - Easy Updates: If `#myButton` changes, update it in one place, not throughout your code.

Because each curried function “remembers” its earlier arguments via closures, you build small, reusable pieces that keep your DOM code clean and straightforward—just like seasoned developers used to do, but with a fresh, functional twist.

## <font color="#4bacc6">Currying vs. Partial Application</font>

- **<font color="#f79646">Currying</font>**: A function in which multiple arguments are accepted is known as the Currying function. By applying the currying function, a function is divided into a series of many functions and each of these functions will accept a single argument unless all the parameters are accepted.
- **<font color="#f79646">Partial Functions</font>**: The idea of the partial application comes from the fact that you can take a system and then split them into multiple systems. In partial application, we create a new function by prefilling some of the arguments to the original function.

Let us see an example and understand the partial application.

```js
const addPartial=(a,b,c) => {
    return a+b+c 
}
var partialFunc= addPartial.bind(this,2,3);
partialFunc(5); //returns 10
```

**Explanation**: In the above example, a function is created that will add the numbers and return the result as output. A **partial function** is one that converts a function into another function but a number of arguments is less there.
## <font color="#4bacc6">Practical Example</font>

Now, let's say that we have an array of objects, something like this:

```js
const list = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Steve',
    email: 'steve@example.com',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'John',
    email: 'john@example.com',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'Pamela',
    email: 'pam@example.com',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: 'Liz',
    email: 'liz@example.com',
  },
];
```

And you want to remove one of the objects if a specific property matches a value, for example if the object name property is equal "John", you want to filter it out.  

The simplest way is to do it in this way:

```js
const noJohn = list.filter(item => item.name !== 'John');
console.log(noJohn);
/**
[
  { id: 1, name: 'Steve', email: 'steve@example.com' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Pamela', email: 'pam@example.com' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Liz', email: 'liz@example.com' }
]
*/
```

That works, but it's not reusable because you are hardcoding the name you want to remove.  
A better way is to wrap it into a function and pass the name as an argument:

``` js
const filterByName = (list, name) => {
  return list.filter(item => item.name !== name);
}

console.log(filterByName(list, 'John'));
/**
[
  { id: 1, name: 'Steve', email: 'steve@example.com' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Pamela', email: 'pam@example.com' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Liz', email: 'liz@example.com' }
]
*
```

Now, imagine that you are going to use the same filter function in two or more places in the same code, or maybe you want to keep the code DRY and you want to place the filtering in a variable on its own. 

You could try this:

```js
const filtering = item => item.name !== name;

const filterByName = (list, name) => {
  return list.filter(filtering);
}
```

But the above will throw you an error as the `filtering` will have no clue of what `name` is.

And here is where **currying comes to action**!

So you will need to change the above code to this:

```js
// we add another function on top of the previous
const filtering = (name) => (item) => item.name !== name;

const filterByName = (list, name) => {
  return list.filter(filtering(name));
}

console.log(filterByName(list, 'John'));
/**
[
  { id: 1, name: 'Steve', email: 'steve@example.com' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Pamela', email: 'pam@example.com' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Liz', email: 'liz@example.com' }
]
*
```

So what happened? The `filtering` function, has a top layer function, that accept the `name` as input, then return a new function that then accept the `item` as argument.

Then the `filter` function will run the result of the `filtering(name)`, which is a function, and it will pass down the item.

If we use the old fashion function syntax, for old timers like me, it would be translated to something like this:

```js
function filterByName(list, name) {
  return list.filter(function(nameToFilter) {
    // nameToFilter is declared at this point
    return function(item) {
      // item is declared here
      return item.name !== nameToFilter;
    }
  }(name));
}
```
## <font color="#4bacc6">Infinite Currying in JavaScript</font>

Suppose there is a function

```js
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)());
```

Basically, this is a function that could sum n numbers. The first thing that came to mind was that “it is currying”. So I tried to make a hard-coded solution that will return a series of functions waiting for the following input.

```js
function sum(a) {
  return function(b){
    return function(c){
      return a+b+c;
    }
  }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)());
```

But the code looks ugly and it is hard coded. It can not work for more arguments. It can only serve the purpose of 3 arguments. So, how can we make this code more generalised and useful for a programmer, and more importantly how to make the interviewer happy?

So here comes one more concept that saves us from doing repetitive tasks
## <font color="#f79646">Recursion</font>

Think about how we can implement recursion in this problem. Firstly, we will have to think of the base case for our recursion to end.

sum(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)……()
## <font color="#f79646">Base Case</font>

As we can see here that this function will go on till a particular condition and what this particular condition is? We will break the recursion when we see that there is no more argument to the function call. We will return the sum when we make the call with no more arguments i.e. on the last ().

Otherwise, we will keep returning a function that will expect us to make a call with one more argument.

```js
function sum(a) {
  return function(b){
    if(!b){
        return a;
    }
    return sum(a+b);
  }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)());  //21
```
