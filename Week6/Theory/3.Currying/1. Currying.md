> Currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each takes a single argument.

Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable multiple times, and it helps you create a higher order function.

1. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable again and again.
2. It helps to create a higher order function.

Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence/series of functions, each taking a single argument.

For example:

``` js
function sum(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
sum(1,2,3); // 6
```

As you can see, this is a function with full arguments. Let’s create a curried version of the function and see how we would call the same function (and get the same result) in a series of calls

```js
function sum(a) {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a + b + c
        }
    }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)) // 6
```

We could even separate this `sum(1)(2)(3)` to understand it better:

```js
const sum1 = sum(1);
const sum2 = sum1(2);
const result = sum2(3);
console.log(result); // 6
```
