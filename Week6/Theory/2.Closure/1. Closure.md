> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

A closure is a function that allows access to variables from its outer function and global variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. This enables functions to "remember" their environment. Some of the features of the closures are mentioned below:

- A closure allows a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) function even after it has finished executing.
- Global variables can be made private within a function using closures, ensuring they cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside.
- Closures provide a way to encapsulate private data and create public methods to interact with it.
- Closures help retain references to variables that would otherwise be lost after the execution of the outer function.

```js
function outer() {
    let outerVar = "I'm in the outer scope!";
    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar);
    }
    return inner;
}
const closure = outer(); 
closure();
```

**Output**

```js
I'm in the outer scope!
```

**In this example**

- outer() defines a local variable outerVar.
- Inside outer(), we define innerFunction, which logs the value of outerVar.
- outer() returns inner(), and closure() stores the returned value (which is inner()).
- Even though outer() has finished execution, inner() can still access outerVar because it "remembers" the environment where it was created. This is the closure at work!
### Lexical Scoping

Closures are based on lexical scoping, meaning that a function’s scope is determined by where the function is defined, not where it is executed. This allows inner functions to access variables from their outer function.

```js
function outer() {
    const outerVar = 'I am from outer';

    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar);
  }

    return inner;
}

const newClosure = outer();
newClosure();
```

**Output**

```js
I am from outer
```

In the example above, inner() has access to outerVar because inner was defined inside outer, giving it access to the outer function's scope.

### <font color="#4bacc6">Private Variables</font>

Closures allow a function to keep variables hidden and only accessible within that function. This is often used when creating modules to protect certain data from being accessed or modified by other parts of the program.

```js
function counter() {
// Private variable
    let count = 0; 
    
    return function () {
     // Access and modify the private variable
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

const increment = counter();
console.log(increment());
console.log(increment());
console.log(increment());
```

**Output**

```js
1
2
3
```

### <font color="#4bacc6"> Closures and IIFE</font>

IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) use closures to hide data inside the function. This helps keep certain information private and prevents it from being accessed outside the function, allowing you to create self-contained modules.

```js
const counter = (function () {
    let count = 0;

    return {
        increment: function () {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        },
        reset: function () {
            count = 0;
            console.log("Counter reset");
        },
    };
})();

counter.increment(); 
counter.increment(); 
counter.reset();
```

**Output**

```js
1
2
Counter reset
```

### <font color="#4bacc6">Closure and setTimeout</font>

Closures are helpful in asynchronous programming because they allow you to keep track of data even after a function has finished running. This is especially useful when you're working with things like timers or server requests, where the function might not run immediately.

```js
function createTimers() {

    for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {

        setTimeout(function () {

            console.log(`Timer ${i}`);

        }, i * 1000);

    }

}

createTimers();
```

Output

```js
Timer 1  
Timer 2  
Timer 3
```

### <font color="#4bacc6">Closures with this keyword</font>

Closures can be confusing when using the this keyword because this depends on how and where a function is called, not where it is defined. So, inside a closure, this might not refer to what you expect based on the function's location.

```js
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    
    this.sayName = function () {
        console.log(this.name);
    };

    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(this.name); 
        // Undefined because 'this' refers to global object
    }.bind(this), 1000); 
    // Fix with bind
}

const G = new Person("GFG");
G.sayName();
```

### <font color="#4bacc6">Function Currying in JavaScript (Closure Example)</font>

Function currying is a technique to transform a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take one argument at a time. Currying relies on closures because each of the intermediate functions has access to the arguments passed previously.

In simple words, currying allows you to create specialized functions by partially applying arguments, which are remembered through closures.

```js
// Normal Function
// function add(a, b) {
//     return a + b;
// }
// console.log(add(2, 3)); 

// Function Currying
function add(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a + b;
    };
}

const addTwo = add(2);  // First function call with 2
console.log(addTwo(3));  // Output: 5
```

**Output**

```js
5
```

#### <font color="#4bacc6"> In this example</font>

- Normal Function: Directly takes two arguments (a and b) and returns their sum.
- Function Currying: Breaks the add function into two steps. First, it takes a, and then, when calling addTwo(3), it takes b and returns the sum.
