In JavaScript, there are essentially three ways to setup event handlers:

## <font color="#4bacc6">1. Use event-handling properties</font>

Many interfaces in JavaScript are extended by these so-called **_event-handling properties_**. They begin with the word _'on'_ followed by the name of an event, all in lowercase, and simply serve one purpose — to hold a handler for the given event.

For instance, taking the `click` event as an example, its corresponding event-handling property is `onclick`. This property is available on all objects that can potentially receive a mouse click on a web page. To be precise, `onclick` is defined on the `HTMLElement` interface.

As a quick example, if we wish to handle the `click` event on the following `<button>` element,

```html
<button>Click me!</button>
```

we'd write something as follows:

```js
var buttonElement = document.querySelector('button');

buttonElement.onclick = function() {
   // Handle the click event over here.
}
```

Here, the function assigned to the `onclick` property is what we'll call the `click` event's handler.

Now, since `onclick` is just another JavaScript property, we can even assign it a function identifier, instead of assigning it an anonymous function expression directly, as demonstrated below:

```js
var buttonElement = document.querySelector('button');

function buttonClickHandler() {
   // Handle the click event over here.
}

buttonElement.onclick = buttonClickHandler;
```

Note that we don't have to call the function `buttonClickHandler()`; just pass its reference to the `onclick` property, which will then automatically be called by the JavaScript engine on the occurrence of a click.

> [!note]
> Event-handling properties are extremely well-supported across a majority of browsers, including the ancient ones. This shouldn't be surprising at all, since they are part of the legacy DOM, which itself has an amazing browser support.
