JavaScript is an astoundingly powerful language, driving the modern-day frontend of the web. Part of this lies in the fact that it comes equipped with a whole ecosystem of **_events_** that allows us to handle given **_actions_**.

The actions can be initiated by the user and be as simple as a mouse click, a key press, or a touch gesture. They can even be browser-initiated, such as completing the loading of a particular resource.

## What are events?

Let's start with the most basic idea — _what exactly is meant by an 'event'?_

Well, technically speaking:

>An **_event_** is an **action** occurring on a web page.

As we stated previously, the action can be initiated either by the user or by the browser itself.

For instance, suppose a user clicks a button on a web page. Here the event is the _'clicking'_ action made by the user. Similarly, when the browser completes the download of a given resource, it might notify the JavaScript engine of this fact. And once again, we have an event — the completion of the resource's download — this time initiated by the browser itself.

In short, whatever the case be, an _event_ is just an _action_.

> _Now how many such actions could you think about, that a user or the browser could initiate while he/she is using a web page?_

To give you a head start, the user can press a key on the keyboard, play an audio element, switch to full screen mode, and... Try writing all your ideas on a piece of paper.
