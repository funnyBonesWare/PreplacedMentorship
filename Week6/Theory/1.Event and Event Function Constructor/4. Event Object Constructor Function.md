### <font color="#4bacc6">What is an “Event object” in the browser?</font>

- **Events represent things happening.**  
    Whenever the user clicks a button, presses a key, moves the mouse, submits a form, or when the browser itself fires something like “DOMContentLoaded,” JavaScript creates an object behind the scenes to describe exactly what happened. That object is called an **Event object**.
    
- **It carries details about the happening.**  
    When you click a button, you don’t just want to know “a click happened” — you also want details like:
    
    - **Which element** was clicked (the button, link, etc.).
        
    - **Where** on the page the mouse was when it was clicked (e.g., `clientX`, `clientY`).
        
    - **Which mouse button** was used (left, right, middle).
        
    - **Whether modifier keys** (Ctrl, Shift, Alt) were held down at the same time.  
        All of those details live on the Event object that the browser automatically hands you.
        
- **Every time you listen to an event, you get that Event object.**  
    Whenever you write code like:

``` js
const myButton = document.querySelector("#myButton");
myButton.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  // ↳ the 'event' parameter here is the Event object
  console.log("User clicked!", event);
  })
```

The browser creates a fresh Event object and passes it as the first argument to your function. Inside that handler, you can inspect `event.type`, `event.target`, `event.preventDefault()`, and so on.

**There are specialized sub-types of Event objects.**

- If you listen for `"keydown"` or `"keypress"`, the browser gives you a **KeyboardEvent** (with extra properties like `event.key`, `event.code`, etc.).
    
- If you listen for `"mousemove"` or `"mousedown"`, you get a **MouseEvent** (with `event.clientX`/`clientY`, `event.button`, etc.).
    
- If you fire a custom event via JavaScript, you might get a **CustomEvent** (which can carry any additional data you attach).  
    Under the hood, all of these inherit from the base `Event` type, but they add specialized fields.

###  <font color="#4bacc6">Anatomy of a built-in Event object</font>

Let’s say you have a simple HTML button:

```HTML
<button id="saveBtn">Save</button>
```

and JavaScript like this:

```JS
const saveBtn = document.querySelector("#saveBtn");

saveBtn.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log("Event type:", event.type);           // "click"
  console.log("Event target:", event.target);       // <button id="saveBtn">Save</button>
  console.log("Mouse X/Y:", event.clientX, event.clientY);
  
  // Prevent the button’s default behavior (if it were e.g. a <button type="submit"> inside a form):
  event.preventDefault();                           
  
  // Stop the event from bubbling up the DOM tree:
  event.stopPropagation();                           
});
```


1. **`event.type`**
    
    - Tells you what kind of event it is (e.g., `"click"`, `"keydown"`, `"submit"`, etc.).
        
2. **`event.target`**
    
    - Points to the actual element that triggered the event (in our example, the `<button>`).
        
3. **Coordinates**
    
    - `event.clientX` and `event.clientY` give you the mouse’s position relative to the **window’s visible area** at the moment of the click.
        
4. **`preventDefault()`**
    
    - Many HTML elements have a “default action” (like a link navigating somewhere, a form submitting, a checkbox toggling). Calling `event.preventDefault()` stops that default from happening.
        
5. **`stopPropagation()`**
    
    - By default, events bubble — if you click a nested element, the same “click” event travels up from the innermost element to its parents. Calling `event.stopPropagation()` prevents it from continuing up the chain.
        
6. **More properties on specialized Event objects**
    
    - A **KeyboardEvent** has `event.key` (e.g., `"Enter"`, `"a"`, `"Shift"`), `event.code` (e.g., `"KeyA"`, `"Digit1"`), and booleans like `event.shiftKey`, `event.ctrlKey`.
        
    - A **MouseEvent** has `event.button` (0 for left, 1 for middle, 2 for right), `event.detail` (number of clicks), `event.movementX`/`movementY` (pixels moved since last mouse event), etc.
        

In short, an Event object is your “detailed report” of exactly what happened in the browser.

### <font color="#4bacc6">The built-in Event constructor function</font>

### Why would you ever call `new Event(...)` yourself?

Most of the time, you don’t manually say `new Event("click")` for native browser events—clicks happen because the user physically clicked. However, there are two main reasons you might use `new Event(...)` in your code:

1. **To dispatch a “synthetic” or “custom” event** that imitates a native one. For example, you might want to programmatically trigger a “resize” event or a custom “user-logged-in” event so that other parts of your code can react.
    
2. **To create a `CustomEvent` with extra data** (using `new CustomEvent("yourEvent", { detail: { ... } })`). This allows you to attach your own payload and have various parts of your app listen for it.

#### <font color="#f79646">Syntax of the built-in `Event` constructor</font>


``` js
// Basic Event:
const myEvent = new Event(typeString, eventInitObject);
```

- **`typeString`** (required): a string representing the event name (e.g., `"click"`, `"scroll"`, `"myCustomAction"`).
    
- **`eventInitObject`** (optional): an object with two possible boolean properties:
    
    - `bubbles` (default `false`): whether the event propagates (bubbles) up through the DOM.
        
    - `cancelable` (default `false`): whether `preventDefault()` can prevent the default action.

Example:

``` js
// Create a synthetic "click" event that bubbles and is cancelable:
const syntheticClick = new Event("click", {
  bubbles: true,
  cancelable: true
});

// Later, you can dispatch it on an element:
const button = document.querySelector("#myButton");
button.dispatchEvent(syntheticClick);
// This will run any "click" listeners on #myButton (and bubble up the chain).
```

#### <font color="#f79646">Creating a CustomEvent for user-defined data</font>


```js
// Suppose you want to notify parts of your app that “userData” has changed:
const dataPayload = { userId: 123, name: "Sahil" };
const userDataChangedEvent = new CustomEvent("userDataChanged", {
  detail: dataPayload,   // put any extra fields you need inside `detail`
  bubbles: true,
  cancelable: false
});

// Somewhere else in your code, you listen:
document.addEventListener("userDataChanged", function(e) {
  console.log("Payload:", e.detail); // { userId: 123, name: "Sahil" }
});

// And when your data actually changes:
document.dispatchEvent(userDataChangedEvent);
```

Under the hood, `CustomEvent` inherits from `Event`, so it has everything a normal Event has, plus your `.detail` property.

## <font color="#4bacc6">“Event constructor function” vs. “my own constructor function”</font>

1. **Built-in Event constructor (“`new Event(...)`”)**
    
    - This is provided by the browser.
        
    - It creates a standard **Event object** (or a subclass like `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, `CustomEvent`) that the browser knows how to handle—particularly in terms of DOM dispatching, bubbling, default actions, etc.
        
    - You rarely reinvent this from scratch; you simply rely on calling `new Event(...)`, `new MouseEvent(...)`, `new KeyboardEvent(...)`, or `new CustomEvent(...)` exactly as the web platform defines.
        
2. **Your own constructor function for custom “event-like” objects**
    
    - Sometimes, rather than using the browser’s dispatch/listener model, you want a lightweight “event emitter” system within your own JavaScript code (not tied to DOM nodes). In that case, you might build something from scratch:


```js
// Example of a very simple “EventBus” constructor:
function EventBus() {
  // Holds arrays of listeners keyed by event name
  this.listeners = {};
}

EventBus.prototype.on = function(eventName, callback) {
  if (!this.listeners[eventName]) {
    this.listeners[eventName] = [];
  }
  this.listeners[eventName].push(callback);
};

EventBus.prototype.off = function(eventName, callback) {
  const arr = this.listeners[eventName] || [];
  const idx = arr.indexOf(callback);
  if (idx !== -1) {
    arr.splice(idx, 1);
  }
};

EventBus.prototype.emit = function(eventName, data) {
  const arr = this.listeners[eventName] || [];
  arr.forEach((cb) => cb(data));
};
```

In that snippet:

- `EventBus` is **your own constructor function** (it’s unrelated to the browser’s built-in `Event`).
    
- You call `new EventBus()` to get an object whose job is simply “manage my own events,” with `.on()`, `.off()`, and `.emit()` methods.
    
- You’re free to name your constructor anything you like (e.g., `EventManager`, `PubSub`, `Dispatcher`).
    

This is a common pattern when you want an internal publish/subscribe system (for instance, in a Node.js backend or in a purely data-driven front-end module), without going through the DOM’s native event mechanism.

## <font color="#4bacc6">Recap: “What are Event objects?”</font>

- **Event objects** are simply JavaScript objects that describe something that happened (usually in the browser).
    
- Whenever you do something like `element.addEventListener("click", handler)`, then inside `handler(event)`, that `event` is an Event object. It carries standard properties (like `.type`, `.target`) plus type-specific extras (for mouse events, keyboard events, etc.).
    
- You **never** need to write `function Event(...) { … }` yourself to answer “What is `<event>`?” for the native browser events. The browser already provides all of that. You just use the Event objects the platform gives you.
## <font color="#4bacc6">Recap: “What is the Event constructor function?”</font>

- The browser defines a built-in constructor function called **`Event`**. It looks like this:
```js
function Event(type, eventInit) { /* built into the browser */ }
```
- Calling `new Event("someEventName", options)` creates a brand-new Event object that you can then dispatch on any DOM node via `.dispatchEvent(...)`.

- You’ll most often see:
    
    - `new Event("click", { bubbles: true, cancelable: true })`
        
    - `new CustomEvent("myCustomName", { detail: { foo: "bar" }, bubbles: true })`
        
    - Specialized versions like `new MouseEvent("mousemove", { clientX: 100, clientY: 150, bubbles: true })` or `new KeyboardEvent("keydown", { key: "Enter", code: "Enter", bubbles: true })`.
        

## <font color="#4bacc6">Putting it all together with a small example</font>

Imagine you have a “Like” button, but you also want to let other parts of your code know whenever someone clicks “Like,” even if they clicked it in a slightly unusual way. You could dispatch your own “like” event programmatically.

```HTML
<button id="likeBtn">Like 👍</button>
```

```js
// 1. Grab the button:
const likeBtn = document.querySelector("#likeBtn");

// 2. Listen to real user clicks:
likeBtn.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log("User physically clicked 'Like' button.");
  
  // Now fire a custom event so other parts of the app can know:
  const likeEvent = new CustomEvent("userLikedSomething", {
    detail: { itemId: 42 }, // maybe this “like” refers to item #42 in a feed
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: false
  });
  likeBtn.dispatchEvent(likeEvent);
});

// 3. Somewhere else in your JavaScript, you listen for that custom event:
document.addEventListener("userLikedSomething", function(e) {
  console.log("Received custom ‘userLikedSomething’ event!", e.detail);
  // e.detail is { itemId: 42 }
  // Maybe send a fetch() to update the server or update UI badges, etc.
});
```

- **Step A:** The real click gives you a native `MouseEvent` object inside the first listener (`function(event) {...}`).
    
- **Step B:** Inside that callback, you create your own **CustomEvent** (using the same underlying Event constructor logic) and give it a `detail` payload.
    
- **Step C:** When you call `likeBtn.dispatchEvent(...)`, the browser hands that new Event object to any other listeners for `"userLikedSomething"`, letting you decouple “pressing the button” from “updating the rest of the UI.”
