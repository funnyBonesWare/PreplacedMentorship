When an event occurs on a given target, its corresponding registered handler function, if there is any, is invoked with a single argument of type object.

This argument is referred to as an **_event object_**.

So to restate it:

> [!info] Defintion
> An **_event object_** refers to the argument sent into an event handler function.

An event object simply represents an event. It contains contextual information regarding the event that caused a given handler to be invoked.

This can include things like the time at which the event occurred, or maybe the name of the event (such as `'click'`), or maybe the target on which the event occurred, and so on and so forth.

In the case of event-handling properties and the `addEventListener()` method, since we define a function ourselves to act as an event's handler, we could name the parameter any way we like and then use it inside the function.

Conventional names are **`e`**, **`event`**, or even **`evt`**, following the fact that the parameter represents an event. It's almost always good to stick to conventions.

Shown below are a couple of examples:

```js
// Assume target is already defined.

target.onclick = function(e) {
   // The event object is: e
}


target.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
   // The event object is: event
});


function clickHandler(nameItAsYouLike) {
   // The event object is: nameItAsYouLike
}

target.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);
```

Moving on, in the case of event-handling HTML attributes, since they don't hold a function, there's no point of even talking about parameters — that's because there ain't any!

Instead what happens in this case is that the event object is available via a local variable called **`event`** that's automatically created by the JavaScript engine when execution enters the context of an event-handling HTML attribute.

Shown below is an example:

```html
<!-- Works -->
<div onclick="console.log(event)"></div>

<!-- Error: e doesn't exist! -->
<div onclick="console.log(e)"></div>
```

An event object implements the **`Event`** interface, at the very least.

The `Event` interface defines a wide variety of useful properties and methods to help us in working more effectively with the Events API in JavaScript.

## <font color="#4bacc6">The `Event` interface</font>

As we already know, there is plethora of possibilities for the kinds of events that could occur on a web page, and likewise, a huge API to work with events in JavaScript.

This obviously means that there possibly has to be a large collection of interfaces, often inheriting from one another, in order to represent all these events. _And there actually are many._

In this section, we'll quickly take a look over the fundamental interface representing all event objects in JavaScript, i.e. the **`Event`** interface.

As its generic name implies:

The **`Event`** interface is the foundation of _all_ event objects in JavaScript.

It defines those features that are common to _all_ events, no matter what their type. This includes things such as the event's name, its target, the time at which is occurred, and so on.

There are even a couple of handy methods defined on the `Event` interface that allow us to configure the behavior and flow of events in the language, including `preventDefault()`, `stopPropagation()`, `stopImmediatePropagation()`, and so on.

The following table summarises some of the properties and methods of the `Event` interface that we'll explore in this chapter, and in the next chapter:

| Property/Method                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`target`**                     | The precise object on which the event occurred.                                                                                               |
| **`type`**                       | The type of the event, also known as the name of the event, denoted as a string. For example, `'click'`.                                      |
| **`time`**                       | A number representing the time at which the event occurred. It holds the number of milliseconds elapsed since the underlying document loaded. |
| **`cancelable`**                 | A Boolean indicating whether or not the event's default action could be prevented.                                                            |
| **`defaultPrevented`**           | A Boolean indicating whether or not the event's default action has been prevented.                                                            |
| **`preventDefault()`**           | Prevents the default action associated with the event.                                                                                        |
| **`stopPropagation()`**          | Stops the event from propagating.                                                                                                             |
| **`stopImmediatePropagation()`** |                                                                                                                                               |
