When an event occurs on a given target, its corresponding registered handler function, if there is any, is invoked with a single argument of type object.

This argument is referred to as an **_event object_**.

So to restate it:

> [!info] Defintion
> An **_event object_** refers to the argument sent into an event handler function.

An event object simply represents an event. It contains contextual information regarding the event that caused a given handler to be invoked.

This can include things like the time at which the event occurred, or maybe the name of the event (such as `'click'`), or maybe the target on which the event occurred, and so on and so forth.

In the case of event-handling properties and the `addEventListener()` method, since we define a function ourselves to act as an event's handler, we could name the parameter any way we like and then use it inside the function.

Conventional names are **`e`**, **`event`**, or even **`evt`**, following the fact that the parameter represents an event. It's almost always good to stick to conventions.

Shown below are a couple of examples:

```js
// Assume target is already defined.

target.onclick = function(e) {
   // The event object is: e
}


target.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
   // The event object is: event
});


function clickHandler(nameItAsYouLike) {
   // The event object is: nameItAsYouLike
}

target.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);
```

Moving on, in the case of event-handling HTML attributes, since they don't hold a function, there's no point of even talking about parameters — that's because there ain't any!

Instead what happens in this case is that the event object is available via a local variable called **`event`** that's automatically created by the JavaScript engine when execution enters the context of an event-handling HTML attribute.

Shown below is an example:

```html
<!-- Works -->
<div onclick="console.log(event)"></div>

<!-- Error: e doesn't exist! -->
<div onclick="console.log(e)"></div>
```

An event object implements the **`Event`** interface, at the very least.

The `Event` interface defines a wide variety of useful properties and methods to help us in working more effectively with the Events API in JavaScript.

## <font color="#4bacc6">The `Event` interface</font>

As we already know, there is plethora of possibilities for the kinds of events that could occur on a web page, and likewise, a huge API to work with events in JavaScript.

This obviously means that there possibly has to be a large collection of interfaces, often inheriting from one another, in order to represent all these events. _And there actually are many._

In this section, we'll quickly take a look over the fundamental interface representing all event objects in JavaScript, i.e. the **`Event`** interface.

As its generic name implies:

The **`Event`** interface is the foundation of _all_ event objects in JavaScript.

It defines those features that are common to _all_ events, no matter what their type. This includes things such as the event's name, its target, the time at which is occurred, and so on.

There are even a couple of handy methods defined on the `Event` interface that allow us to configure the behavior and flow of events in the language, including `preventDefault()`, `stopPropagation()`, `stopImmediatePropagation()`, and so on.

The following table summarises some of the properties and methods of the `Event` interface that we'll explore in this chapter, and in the next chapter:

| Property/Method                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **`target`**                     | The precise object on which the event occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **`type`**                       | The type of the event, also known as the name of the event, denoted as a string. For example, `'click'`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **`time`**                       | A number representing the time at which the event occurred. It holds the number of milliseconds elapsed since the underlying document loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`cancelable`**                 | A Boolean indicating whether or not the event's default action could be prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`defaultPrevented`**           | A Boolean indicating whether or not the event's default action has been prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`preventDefault()`**           | Prevents the default action associated with the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`stopPropagation()`**          | Stops the event from propagating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **`stopImmediatePropagation()`** | The **`stopImmediatePropagation()`** method of the `Event` interface prevents other listeners of the same event from being called.<br><br>If several listeners are attached to the same element for the same event type, they are called in the order in which they were added. If `stopImmediatePropagation()` is invoked during one such call, no remaining listeners will be called, either on that element or any other element. |
Now clearly, since every single event couldn't sensibly be represented to its entirety by just one single interface, i.e. `Event`, there are some specialized interfaces extending `Event` that represent specific sets of events.

For example, many events in JavaScript could be grouped under the category of mouse events, by virtue of being initiated by the mouse. They share common information and functionality, such as denoting the x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer. Likewise, in JavaScript, the `MouseEvent` interface is made to specifically represent these mouse events.

`MouseEvent` extends `UIEvent`, which is yet another interface meant to represent events initiated inside or by the user interface. `UIEvent` extends `Event`, which we've already discussed.

## <font color="#4bacc6">Preventing default behavior</font>

As you create more and more JavaScript programs leveraging the Events API, you'll eventually come to a point where you'll want to tap into the default behavior associated with a particular event.

For instance, you might want to prevent the click event on links (i.e. `<a>` elements) from loading the page pointed to by their `href`. Or you might want to prevent data from being displayed in an `<input>` field the moment it's entered into it. Or you might want to prevent a form from being submitted when its submit button is pressed.

Whatever the case be, you'll someday want to prevent the _normal_ behavior that user agents perform upon the occurrence of a particular event.

Fortunately, there's a very simple and neat way to do so using JavaScript — just call the **`preventDefault()`** method of the event.

The **`preventDefault()`** method of the `Event` interface is made to instruct the browser engine to prevent the default behavior associated with the current event.

No argument needs to be provided to the method. Conventionally, it's called right at the start of the handler function, but there's no such necessity — you could even make it the last statement of your function body, or put it simply anywhere in between.

`preventDefault()` might seem like magic, but there really isn't anything such as magic in the world of a programmer, is there? Everything is theoretical and/or practical.

Talking about `preventDefault()`, it executes an almost-one-liner command which has absolutely nothing magical in it. It's rather the way an event gets fired in JavaScript that allows us to tap into its (implementation-defined) default behavior for a given target and stop it from being executed.

The supposed magic lies purely in the [event dispatch algorithm](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dispatching-events).

_It's time to unravel some of the pseudo-magic of this algorithm along with what exactly `preventDefault()` does_.

The moment `preventDefault()` is called on a particular event object, the browser engine sets an internal **_canceled_** flag for that event object.

When JavaScript constructs an event object and then dispatches it on a given target, it sets its **`cancelable`** attribute to a Boolean value as per a given events specification.

The `cancelable` property of the `Event` interface simply tells whether or not a given event is cancelable . In other words, it states whether calling `preventDefault()` on an event would have any effect or not.

For instance, as defined in the [UI Events standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/), the `cancelable` property of the `click` event is `true`. Hence, applications could invoke `preventDefault()` on a `click` event and then expect it to have an effect (such as preventing the browser from following the `href` of an `<a>` element).

Events whose `cancelable` property is `false`, calling `preventDefault()` has absolutely no effect on them. An example would be the `blur` event.
