Technical -> Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. 
Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces.

Key Concepts:
1. Flex Container
   - Created by setting display: flex
   - Parent element that holds flex items
   - Can be either row (horizontal) or column (vertical)

2. Main Properties for Container:
   - flex-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse
   - justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around
   - align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center
   - flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
   - gap: sets spacing between flex items

3. Properties for Flex Items:
   - flex-grow: determines growth factor
   - flex-shrink: determines shrink factor
   - flex-basis: sets initial main size
   - align-self: overrides container's align-items
   - order: controls item ordering

Common Use Cases:
- Navigation bars
- Card layouts
- Centering content
- Equal-height columns
- Dynamic layouts

Detailed Theory:

4. Flex Axes:
   - Main Axis: Primary axis along which flex items are placed (horizontal in row, vertical in column)
   - Cross Axis: Perpendicular to the main axis
   - Understanding these axes is crucial for alignment properties

5. Advanced Concepts:
    - Flex Shorthand: flex: grow shrink basis
     Example: flex: 1 1 auto (flexible growth, flexible shrink, auto basis)
   - flex: 1 = flex: 1 1 0% (common pattern for equal width)
   - Negative space distribution
   - Flex item sizing calculations
